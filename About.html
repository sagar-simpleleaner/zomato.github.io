Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, read and write customer generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make payments while dining-out at restaurants. On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business while also providing a reliable and efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners.
